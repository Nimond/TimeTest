# TimeTest
Checking execution time of python functions.


Now you can check execution time of your functions using:
    `averagetime_test(function_name, count_of_calls, *args, **kwagrs)` to see average time of execution
    `alltime_test(function_name, count_of_calls, *args, **kwagrs)` to see list of function executions times
